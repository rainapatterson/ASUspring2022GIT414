For this school assignment we are creating a website for a fictional or real business that we have a connection to.  The site is meant to be a new design, no redesigns. This assignment started by conducting a website discovery survey, planning website content, and then creating wireframes and mockups. This site will use HTML &amp; CSS and will be responsive.
In this assignment I will be working with grid for the first time.
